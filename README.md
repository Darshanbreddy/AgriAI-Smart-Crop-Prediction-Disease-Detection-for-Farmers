AgriAI: A Machine Learning Web Application for Agricultural Decision Making
AgriAI is a cutting-edge machine learning-powered web application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about their crops. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and deep learning techniques, AgriAI helps predict the most suitable crops for a given environment and detects crop diseases, offering farmers insights to optimize crop yield and reduce losses.

Key Highlights:
Crop Yield Prediction: Achieved an impressive 98% accuracy in predicting crop yield using the Random Forest algorithm. The model factors in environmental conditions, weather, and soil quality to recommend the most suitable crops for a given region.

Crop Disease Detection: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of classifying 13,324+ plant images across 17 species. This model can effectively detect and classify crop diseases based on visual data, enabling farmers to take preventive measures.

Research-Driven Approach: Evaluated over 70 research papers to select the optimal models for crop prediction and disease detection, ensuring the highest possible performance and accuracy.

Data Quality Enhancement: Utilized SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset and improve the accuracy of the disease detection model, addressing class imbalance in the dataset.

Deployment: The application was deployed using Anvil, with a Python backend, allowing farmers to access it easily via the web interface. The solution is user-friendly and designed to work on any modern web browser.
